New York Mortgage Decisions 

The data problem is what variables are necessary to predict mortgage decisions based on the variables provided in “ny_hmda_2015.csv” such as race, gender, and income. The managerial objective is to obtain an accurate model to predict the outcome of mortgage decisions. The measurement types of each variable are shown in the following table. 





```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
